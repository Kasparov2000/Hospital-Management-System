# Hospital-Management-System

The program is accessible through terminal.py The requirements (modules) required for the program are in the requirements.txt file Open the the directory containing requirements file and run this command 'pip install -r requirements.txt' The medical reports and receipts are stored in the medical reports and receipts folders. The ADMIN username is BinushaALU, password: binusha. She is the doctor. The admin has the power to add new staff, update prices, collect money etc. When registering patients, only valid emails are accepted since the receipts and medical records forms are sent directly to their emails. I used PYTHON & MONGOENGINE for this project. You can setup your db connection if you would like, but I put mine already
